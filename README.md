# Pokesite

A website dedicated to pokemon.

- Uses modern ES6 javascript syntax and modules with no frameworks
- Uses modern CSS3 styling with flexbox and keyframe animations
- Uses the free pokeapi to fetch and then cache results in the browser
- Implements pagination/caching on scrolling so we do not spam the the pokeapi (be nice to your free APIs!!)

I did this for learning fun! There are so many javascript frameworks out there but building simple sites is not that hard and this is an attribution to that idea. I hope you enjoy learning from this because I know I did!

# Running Locally

You will need a live server of some kind to server these files since they use Javascript Modules and those can only be served with the HTTP protocol.
VSCode has a nice live server extension you can use: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

You can serve these files up with nginx too or some webserver
