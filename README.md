# Pokesite

A website dedicated to pokemon.

- Uses modern ES6 javascript syntax and modules with no frameworks
- Uses modern CSS3 styling with flexbox and keyframe animations
- Uses the free pokeapi to fetch and then cache results in the browser

I did this for learning fun! There are so many javascript frameworks out there but building simple sites is not that hard and this is an attribution to that idea. I hope you enjoy learning from this because I know I did!
